## Language Files

If you want to add language file for your own language, create a pull request!

Please make sure the name of your language file is lower-case like `en_us.lang` but not `en_US.lang`, or low versions of Minecraft and Optifine won't read them.

## Install

### Due to PTGI's EULA, its illegal to distribute PTGI's code directly, so you need to follow these steps to extract SEUS PTGI GFME

1. Download the jar file from release page, and download a **vanilla unedited** GFME based PTGI version (currently HRR 2.1) file from [Cody's Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/sonicether/posts) if you don't have one.

2. Put the jar file and PTGI HRR 2.1 file into the same path, and double click the jar file. If everything is fine, there will be a new folder (older version of GFME) or a zip file (newer GFME version) that can be used directly as a shaderpack by moving this file or folder into .minecraft/shaderpacks.

If there is nothing happened while double clicking jar, you can run this jar in CMD or Powershell by `java -jar "<your GFME jar path>"` for more information.
